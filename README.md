Cellular teeth involve the process of model building.  
Teeth classification includes a simple deployment using Streamlit.  
The dependencies needed to run the ipynb file, it's your `.env` file, which contains your API key for Neptune.  
The dependencies required to run `teeth_classification.py` are specified in `requirements.txt`.
